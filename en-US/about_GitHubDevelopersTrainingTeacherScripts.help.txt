GET USERS FORM A CLASS

    Use the command Get-ClassAttendeeHandles to get the users from a class

    > Get-ClassAttendeeHandles -RepoName rulasg-231010
    rulasg

TEST IF USER HAVE THEIR ACTIVITY REPO READY

    Use the command Test-ActivityRepo with the output of Get-ClassAttendeeHandles to test if the users if a hole class have their activity repo exists.

    The following command extracts the class members of rulasg-231010 and checks for each user if the conflict-practice repo exists.

    > Get-ClassAttendeeHandles -RepoName rulasg-231010 | Test-ActivityRepo -ActivityRepo conflict-practice

    User       Repo                                               Exists
    ----       ----                                               ------
    rulasg     ps-developers-sandbox/conflict-practice-rulasg       True

    > Get-ClassAttendeeHandles -RepoName rulasg-231010 | Test-ActivityRepo -ActivityRepo github-games

    User       Repo                                          Exists

CONFLICT PRACTICE REPO about_GitHubDevelopersTrainingTeacherScripts

    Some times the creation of conflict-practice repos fail partially. So the repo exists but is not fully ready. Use the command Test-ConflictPracticeRepoPR3 to check that the repo contains 3 Pull Requests, proving that the repo is fully ready for the conflict practice.

    Use the Get-ClassAttendeeHandles command to chose the users to test.

    > Get-ClassAttendeeHandles -RepoName rulasg-231010 | Test-ConflictPracticeRepoPR3

    User       Repo                                               Exists

    rulasg     ps-developers-sandbox/conflict-practice-rulasg       True

WHO IS THE TEACHER OF AN ACTIVITY REPO

    Sometimes when running the `script/teacher-class` script fails beacuse th user has already an activity script in the organization.
    As you as teacher is not the owner of the actual user repo you are no able to delete it. So you need to find the teacher of the repo and ask him to delete it. 

    Use the command commands `Get-TeacherOfConflictPracticeRepo` and `Get-TeacherOfGithubGameRepo` to find the teacher of the repo.

    >  "raulgeu" | Get-TeacherOfConflictPracticeRepo

    login  name

    Do this on a single command piping Get-ClassRepo with Get-ClassAttendeeHandles and Remove-ActivitiesRepo.

CLEAN UP BEHIND You

    To save problems to teacher that may come behind you, remove the ActivityRepos that you create. This way if a user repeats training, the second teacher will not have problems not being able to delete and recreate repos for that user.
